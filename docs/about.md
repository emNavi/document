**emNavi** is an open-source project derived from "**Em**bodied **Navi**gation". The vision of emNavi is to re-construct and optimize the navigation-related SoTA (state of the art) algorithms and apply them on robots, especially aerial robots, to promote the implementation of Embodied AI on mobile robots.
