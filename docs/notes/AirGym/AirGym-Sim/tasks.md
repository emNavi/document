> Four tasks have been implemented: Hovering, Balloon-hitting, Tracking Lemniscate, Avoid Dynamic Obstacle.

### Hovering
Description: quadrotors are expected to be initialized randomly inside a cube with a side length of 2 meters, then converge into the center and hover until the end of the episode.

### Balloon-hitting
Description: this task is essentially a variation of the hovering task, but with a key difference: the quadrotor moves at a higher speed, rapidly dashing toward the target without hovering demand.
