It integrates racing drone power, sensing, and onboard computating capability. The X152b flight platform features a 152mm frame size and utilizes the Khadas Edge2 onboard computing platform, integrated with the Rockchip RK3588S chip. It is powered by a 4×Cortex-A76 + 4×Cortex-A55 processor setup, delivering 6 TOPS of AI computing power. The platform is equipped with a RealSense D430 camera, capable of capturing stereo infrared and depth images. The X152b employs a 5-inch racing drone propulsion system, offering agile and powerful performance during high-maneuverability operations, with a maximum speed of up to 30 m/s. Additionally, it incorporates burly high-impact shell from OddityRC, making it safe and durable.
