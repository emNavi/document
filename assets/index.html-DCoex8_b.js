Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying the learning-based method to the end-to-end control of drones, but rarely mention the infrastructure system from simulation to reality. This makes it challenging to reproduce or generalize many research outcomes in real-world scenarios, thereby limiting the practical application of learning-based approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a system that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end DRL policies. Our system is built on the open-sourced community and strictly aligned with the real-world system. Besides, we further introduce an intermediate software layer comprising AirGym-Real and control_for_gym, which harmonize sensor data, actuator dynamics, and control interfaces between simulated and real-world domains. It is vital that we utilize a set of skills, including domain randomization, hover throttle alignment, and hierarchical state processing, to enable the seamless policy transfer. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate robust outdoor flight performance under real-world perturbations, including wind gusts and sensor noise, and systematically analyze critical factors—such as domain randomization and observational fidelity—that underpin successful zero-shot transfer. </div><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation"><span><strong>Motivation</strong></span></a></h2><div class="custom-line-height"> Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying the learning-based method to the end-to-end control of drones, but rarely mention the infrastructure system from simulation to reality.
